### Technologies Used

#### React | React Router | React Hooks

#### Redux | Redux Thunk | Redux Hooks

I prefer Redux, because it makes application more scalable in the future if needed. Redux setup is relatively easy and low time consuming, so even for a small application like this I enjoy benefits Redux provides. I have used Redux Thunk to make it easier to dispatch action that has network request.

#### Axios

I prefer using Axios rather that Fetch, because Axios transforms JSON data automatically.

#### Jest | React Testing Library

#### CSS
